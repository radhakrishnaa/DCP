Do not delete this file from the git repo since it forces
git to store the parent "publish_out" directory.

Once deployed to the server this file is no longer needed,
but there is no harm in leaving it around.

If you want to stop the server from logging the current
and new setting values when publishing, then simply remove
the entire publish_out directory.
